<p><em>Stay away from cats!</em></p>

<p>Why, do you ask? Because <strong>cats are evil</strong>!</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by their cuddly and adorable look, but here are the facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cats are murdering monsters.</li>
  <li>Cats are the favoured pets of witches.</li>
  <li>Cats transmit parasites that rewires your brain and <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/03/how-your-cat-is-making-you-crazy/308873/>

</ul>

<p>Now that you have been convinced by the facts, I am sure you will join me on this three-point plan to stop cats from taking over the world:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce mandatory cat facts awareness programmes in all schools in the whole world.</li>
