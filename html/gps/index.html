    <h3>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h3>
    
    <p>Semantic tags provide meaning to text that the parser (such as a web browser, a feed reader or a developer) can interpret and render.</p>

    <h3>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h3>

    <p>It starts from the top of the html file and displays the elements as they are found (within the body element).</p>

    <h3>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h3>

    <p>Learned to write snippets, which can save a lot of time. I'm definitely going to set up some more snippets for elements that keep recurring.</p>

    <h3>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h3>

    <p>Where to correctly store Sublime Text snippets took some time to find. Also, still want to learn about how to set the scope for the snippets - specifying scope as source.html did not seem to work. Will research</p>
