## Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

    sqlite> SELECT * FROM votes;
    1|1|false|1997|Arizona
    2|1|false|2016-11-08|Arizona
    3|1|true|2016-11-08 12:08:43|New York
    4|2|true|2016-11-08 15:05:33|New York
    5|1|true|2016-11-08 17:45:43|California

## Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

    sqlite> UPDATE votes SET valid="true", time_cast="2016-11-08 11:08:43" WHERE id=2;

## Display the information in both tables using one query.

    sqlite> SELECT * FROM votes, candidates WHERE votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
    1|1|false|1997|Arizona|1|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    2|1|true|2016-11-08 11:08:43|Arizona|1|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    3|1|true|2016-11-08 12:08:43|New York|1|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    4|2|true|2016-11-08 15:05:33|New York|2|Donald John Trump
    5|1|true|2016-11-08 17:45:43|California|1|Hillary Rodham Clinton

## Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
1|Hillary Rodham Clinton
2|Hillary Rodham Clinton
3|Hillary Rodham Clinton
4|Donald John Trump
5|Hillary Rodham Clinton

## Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

    sqlite> DELETE FROM votes WHERE valid="false";

## Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

    sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates INNER JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
    2|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    3|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    4|Donald John Trump
    5|Hillary Rodham Clinton

    sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates LEFT JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
    2|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    3|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    5|Hillary Rodham Clinton
    4|Donald John Trump

    sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates RIGHT JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
    Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

    sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates FULL OUTER JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;

    sqlite> SELECT votes.id, candidates.name FROM candidates NATURAL JOIN votes ON votes.vote_for = candidates.id;
